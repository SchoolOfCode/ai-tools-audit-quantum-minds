## The Upshot

M1 is a tool for market and user research. It can assist with connecting a product with a target audience (or indeed finding out what that target audience might be) or connecting a target audience with a product; being able to audit the problems they may or may not face in their daily lives. Furthermore it can assist with the best ways to conduct user research on a given target audience and offer the potential problems they might face with providing feedback. Needless to say this greatly accelerates UX / UI elements of the building process, which can be a massive bottleneck to engineering stacks. With this tool a substantial portion of the aches and pains will be alleviated.

## The Downside

As one might expect, the greatest drawback here is the language model itself; the AI model will likely struggle if given a particularly niche market it has no prior understanding of. Further to this it might take some user know-how to operate correctly for their specific product or demographic. Hallucinations can also be fairly problematic. If this tool is used by people with no other expertise in marketing, and this is all the team is going off of, it could cause catastrophic errors

## Tangible Benefits

Can significantly downsize and accelerate marketing, allowing tech stacks to do what they do best. As mentioned previously market / user research can be an enormous bottleneck, so removing some of the irritants here will make the dev cycle a lot more painless

## Reccomendation

Adopt. Whilst errors can be quite significant if mismanaged, it's quite easy to not fall into pitfalls of designing a product for a hallucinated target audience. On the other hand, alleviating pressure from the annoying part of developing is a massive upside that keep software engineers firmly in their element
