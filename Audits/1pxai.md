## The Upshot 

Assuming you have the basics of asynchronous code with async / awaits / promises etc. The thing that is the most likely element to tank performance is how you handle images. This is where 1pxai comes in.

1pxai assists in optimising file size for images with various rendering techniques that can do it fast and without compromising image quality. This can be incredibly useful whenever you need to store high quality images without tanking website / loading performance. Further to this, it can integrate with the browser directly, which makes it a lot more user friendly. 

## The Downsides

Typically with this sort of ai model, you'll want it to be a one and done type of thing; you have an image and you make it smaller and look crisper. This can be a bit of an issue, therefore, considering that there is no trial and no model for one time users; operating solely off of subscriptions. 

## Benefits

The benefits are largely for the end user. If the images on the site load faster and look better they are more likely to deem the company as professional and worthy of business leading to an increase in revenue. This tool as a whole would not inherently assist in development

## Final Reccomendation 

Do not adopt. This tool is best utilised to display and art portfolio or social media page. One in which image efficiency and quality are of the utmost importance. For a tech stack this tool will only glean occaisonal use that will not outweigh the subscription price.
