## Introduction

AI is currently an invaluable tool that can greatly assist in development processes; greatly increasing the speed at which development cycles can operate. To truly compete in the modern market most tech stacks will need to leverege this emerging technology. That said, this axis can be quite difficult to navigate making it necessary to do some research into this field.

TechForge Industries have asked us to investigate various AI based tools that could help them become more productive across a variety of different areas. Enclosed are 4 audits pertaining to 4 different AI tools that can assist in various executive functions.

## Audit Summary 

### 1PX

This tool is geared to image quality and compression. It could assist with improving the user experience by cutting down on loading times and improving image quality overall. However, the limited usage a tech stack would get out of it is ultimately not worth the necessary subscription to use it. 1PX is ultimately not reccomended

### M1

This is a tool that will be able to create user profiles of people that would be interested in a product or vice versa. It could help alleviate the largest bottleneck of development; product managment, allowing software engineers to focus on the actual software and other things they are more equipped to do. It does require a little know how to not apply this in scenarios that it is not equipped to handle, but this is very minor of a complaint. The tool is still thoroughly reccomended

### Cursor 

Cursor, an AI-powered code editor, promises increased developer productivity and improved code quality. Features like AI completion and natural language commands can speed up development and 
Intercom, an AI-powered customer service platform, offers TechForge the potential for 24/7 support, streamlined workflows, and valuable customer insights. However, challenges like per-resolution costs, security concerns, and integration complexity require careful consideration. To evaluate its suitability, TechForge should pilot Intercom, focusing on cost analysis, data security, integration effort, and customer feedback. This will help determine if Intercom aligns with their budget and customer service approach.

### Intercom

Intercom, an AI-powered customer service platform, offers TechForge the potential for 24/7 support, streamlined workflows, and valuable customer insights. However, challenges like per-resolution costs, security concerns, and integration complexity require careful consideration. To evaluate its suitability, TechForge should pilot Intercom, focusing on cost analysis, data security, integration effort, and customer feedback. This will help determine if Intercom aligns with their budget and customer service approach.

## Conclusion

Out of the 4 Audits conducted, 3 of the AI tools are encouraged to adopt; M1 , Intercom , and Cursor. It is felt that all mentioned tools will greatly increase development speed. AI , whilst a powerful tool , must be consistently evaluated and found to be of assistance for continued use.
